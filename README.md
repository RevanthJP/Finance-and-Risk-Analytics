EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
 The objective of this project is to create an Indian credit risk(default) model, using the data provided. There are two machine learning models â€“ Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifier models have been used to predict the defaulter in this project.

INTRODUCTION
Though the main objective of the project is to build an Indian credit risk(default) model, various steps have been taken before the same model. First, the given dataset was imported using pandas library and preprocessing steps such as missing value treatment, outlier treatment, descriptive analysis, graphical representations of the features are done. With all these preprocessing a better cleaner data is obtained and is used for training and testing the model built. Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier are the two models built and results are evaluated through metrics such as accuracy score, classification report, confusion matrix and roc_auc curve.
